Ideas:
======

- trailer play on intro screen after some time has elapsed (dead space like)

- when a bot dies and player is looking at it freeze the game for a frame, don't
  if many are dying and if multiple die in AOE freeze once. 

- frame rates -> {30; 48; 60; 128; 256; 512; 1024; 2048; 4096; 8192; unlimited}

- Weapons
    * ...usual line-up of melee, pistol, shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher,
    overpowered exotic thing that you never get ammo for and only use in boss 
    fights anyway - Yahtzee

* menus - http://kotaku.com/5955855/the-ten-commandments-of-video-game-menus
    For there are but a few basic types of menus, and we shall agree on what goes
    here. Subtitle toggling shall forever go under audio, not video video, not 
    audio. (Okay, we art convinced.) Y-axis inversion shall forever go under controls,
    not gameplay. Difficulty and violence filters shall be placed under gameplay, 
    however. PC games shall condense the "video" and "graphics" menus into one menu
    called "video," because we think we can all agreeth that we do not need two menus
    for video options and that "graphics" is a silly term.

You want to quit? Then, thou hast lost an eighth!
Get outta here and go back to your boring programs. 
You're lucky I don't smack you for thinking about leaving. 
Just leave. When you come back, I'll be waiting with a bat.
Are you sure you want to quit this great game? 
I wouldn't leave if I were you, life is much worse. 
You're trying to say you like tumbr better than me, right?
Porn break?
This is where it had to end.
I'd been here before too many times. 
Better to live a lie than face the truth.
But you can't give up now!
But there are still too many questions left unanswered...
Go ahead and leave. See if I care.
